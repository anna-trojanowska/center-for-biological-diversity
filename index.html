                <h4>Tell Obama: Declare Climate Emergency, Ban Oil Exports</h4>
                <p>The end-of-year budget deal signed into law contains a provision repealing the 40-year-old ban on the export of crude oil, which could increase domestic oil production by more than 3 million barrels a day — an alarming figure for our climate and species like corals and polar bears.</p>
                <p>Tell the president to declare a climate emergency and reinstate the ban on crude oil exports.</p>

                    <p>Ending new fossil fuel leasing on America's public lands and offshore areas would keep up to 450 billion tons of greenhouse gases from polluting our atmosphere, says a new study commissioned by the Center and Friends of the Earth.</p>

Cost Taxpayers $1 Billion Over Past Decade</h4>
                    <p>An analysis commissioned by the Center finds that U.S. taxpayers have lost more than $1 billion over the past decade on a program that allows grazing on public lands — and is operating on a staggering loss. In 2014 alone taxpayers lost $125 million in grazing subsidies on federal land.</p>
